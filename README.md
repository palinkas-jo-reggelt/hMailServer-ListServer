# hMailServer-ListServer

ListServer for hMailServer 

I did not write this. I merely saved it after the original version disappeared from the internet after 11 years. I also incorporated all of the fixes posted in the original thread as well as separated the listserv script from EventHandlers.vbs. This version should be working out of the box with the latest hMailServer.
